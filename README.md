**CEopt: Cross-Entropy Optimizer** is a Matlab package that implements a framework for nonconvex optimization using the Cross-Entropy (CE) method. Due to the algorithm's relative simplicity, CEopt provides a transparent "gray-box" optimization solver with intuitive control parameters. It effectively handles both equality and inequality constraints through an augmented Lagrangian method, offering robustness and scalability for moderately sized complex problems. CEopt's applicability and effectiveness are demonstrated through select case studies, making it a practical addition to optimization research and application toolsets.
